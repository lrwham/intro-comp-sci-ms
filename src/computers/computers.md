# Computers

Computers are ubiquitous.[^1]

The origins of the word "computer" are from the Latin word *computare*, which means "to calculate". The first use of the word computer was in the 17th century, when it was used to describe a person who performed calculations or computations. Humans continued to fill the role of "computer" until the first machines for computation were invented during the industrial revolution. The first of these machines was the Difference Engine, which was designed by Charles Babbage in 1822. The Difference Engine was a mechanical calculator that could perform basic mathematical operations.

The term "computer" continued to be used to describe a person who performed calculations into the 20th century. Famously[^2], human computers, often women, were employed at NASA during the early days of the space race. These human computers performed the calculations necessary to send the first American into space and eventually to the moon.

These human computers had the aid of some early devices we might think of as "calculators" today. These were not electronic devices but rather manual mathematical tools, including slide rules[^3], mechanical calculators, and of course, pencils and lots of paper.

Eventually electronic computers were invented, and the term "computer" came to refer to the machines themselves. Today, electronic computers are found in our pockets, on our wrists, in our tools and toys, inside sports equipment, etc.

[^1]Ubiquitous: present, appearing, or found everywhere. *That means computers are everywhere!*

[^2]Hidden Figures features the story of Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden, who were human computers at NASA. The movie is based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly.

[^3]Slide rules were common tools for performing calculations before the widespread use of electronic calculators and computers. They allowed users to perform various mathematical operations, including multiplication, division, logarithms, and more.
