# Run Your First Code

Open Visual Studio Code. Create a file and type the following code into it:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Save the file as `hello_world.py`. You can save it anywhere you like, but it is a good idea to *know* where you saved it.

To run your code in Visual Studio Code, press `Ctrl+F5` or click on the `Run` menu and select `Run Without Debugging`. On a Mac, press `Control+F5`. On a Mac, you may need to hold the `fn` key as well.
