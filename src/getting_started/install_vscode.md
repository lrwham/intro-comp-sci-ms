# Install VsCode

You will need a way to write code. We will use a program called Visual Studio Code. This is a free program that you can download and install on your computer.

Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.

If you are not able to install programs, you may be able to download the portable version. Download the zip file and extract it to a folder. You can then run the program by double clicking on the executable file.

This zip file will be called something like `VSCode-win32-x64-1.85.1.zip` if you are on Windows or `VSCode-darwin-universal.zip` if you are on a Mac.

Go to [1.2 Run Your First Code](./run_your_first_code.md) to continue.
